MODE_HELP = """
Choose between `OpenAI` which uses the openai library to make API calls, or `Local` which runs all operations (Embedding, Vector Stor and LLM) locally.\n
To enable `Local` mode (disabled for the demo) set `ENABLE_LOCAL_MODE` to `True` in `datachad/constants.py` before deploying the app.\n
Furthermore you need to have the model binaries downloaded and stored inside `./models/`\n
"""

LOCAL_MODE_DISABLED_HELP = """
This is a demo hosted with limited resources. Local Mode is not enabled.\n
To use Local Mode deploy the app on your machine of choice with `ENABLE_LOCAL_MODE` set to `True`.
"""

AUTHENTICATION_HELP = f"""
Your credentials are only stored in your session state.\n
The keys are neither exposed nor made visible or stored permanently in any way.\n
Feel free to check out [the code base]({PROJECT_URL}) to validate how things work.
"""

USAGE_HELP = f"""
These are the accumulated OpenAI API usage metrics.\n
The app uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` for chat and `text-embedding-ada-002` for embeddings.\n
Learn more about OpenAI's pricing [here](https://openai.com/pricing#language-models)
"""

OPENAI_HELP = """
You can sign-up for OpenAI's API [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).\n
Once you are logged in, you find the API keys [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

ACTIVELOOP_HELP = """
You can create an ActiveLoops account (including 500GB of free database storage) [here](https://www.activeloop.ai/).\n
Once you are logged in, you find the API token [here](https://app.activeloop.ai/profile/gustavz/apitoken).\n
The organisation name is your username, or you can create new organisations [here](https://app.activeloop.ai/organization/new/create)
"""

UPLOAD_HELP = """
You can upload a single or multiple files. With each upload, all files in the batch are embedded into a single vector store.\n
**Important**: If you upload new files after you already have uploaded files, a new vector store that includes all previously uploaded files is created.
This means for each combination of uploaded files, a new vector store is created.\n
To treat your new upload independently, you need to remove the previous uploads by clicking the `X`, right next to the uploaded file name.\n
**!!! All uploaded files are removed permanently from the app after the vector stores are created !!!**
